# American Revolutionary War

This is the home of the source code of the American Revolutionary War gamemode for Garry's Mod, created by Senpai Noodles and Iamgoofball.

The assets for the gamemode are hosted in the three following addons/collections
1. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=271032984
2. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=804680245
3. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=806499234
Please make sure these are all installed on your server and being sent to clients! I would of uploaded the sources for the "ARW Meme Content"(the addon that contains the vgui and sounds)
but it doesn't work well with Git.

# Installation
Drag/drop the "arw" folder into your gamemodes folder on the server.
Ensure all addons mentioned above are installed and being sent to clients.
Set the map to arw_fields.

Enjoy!
